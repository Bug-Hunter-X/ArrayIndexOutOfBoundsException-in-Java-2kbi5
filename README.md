# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds, resulting in the exception.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.java`, addresses the issue by ensuring the index remains within the valid range of the array.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and careful array indexing in Java programming.
